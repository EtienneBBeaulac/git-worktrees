# git-worktrees

> Simple, powerful Git worktree management with fuzzy finding

## Why Git Worktrees?

Work on multiple branches simultaneously without the pain of `git stash` and constant branch switching.

**Before worktrees:**
```bash
# Working on a feature
$ git checkout feature-branch
# ... coding ...

# Need to quickly check main
$ git stash                    # üò∞ Save your work
$ git checkout main            # Switch branch
# ... check something ...
$ git checkout feature-branch  # Switch back
$ git stash pop                # ü§û Hope nothing breaks
```

**With worktrees:**
```bash
# Each branch is its own directory
$ cd ~/code/repo-feature/      # Work on feature
$ cd ~/code/repo-main/         # Check main
$ cd ~/code/repo-feature/      # Back to work
# Everything stays intact! ‚ú®
```

**Perfect for:**
- üéØ Working on multiple features simultaneously
- üëÄ Reviewing PRs without losing your current work
- üß™ Running tests on one branch while developing another
- üîç Comparing branches side-by-side in different editor windows

## Commands

**Interactive hub:**
- `wt` ‚Äì Interactive fuzzy finder to list, switch, create, and manage worktrees

**Subcommands:**
- `wt new` / `wt n` ‚Äì Create/open a worktree for a new or existing branch
- `wt remove` / `wt rm` ‚Äì Safely remove a worktree (guards against uncommitted/unpushed work)
- `wt open` / `wt o` ‚Äì Open an existing worktree for a branch
- `wt list` / `wt ls` ‚Äì List worktrees with status (clean/dirty, ahead/behind)
- `wt prune` ‚Äì Remove stale worktree references
- `wt config` ‚Äì Manage configuration (edit, show, init)
- `wt help` ‚Äì Show detailed help

**Quick access (shorthand):**
- `wtnew`, `wtrm`, `wtopen`, `wtls` ‚Äì Direct commands (same as subcommands, just faster to type)

## Install

### Via Homebrew (Recommended)

```bash
brew tap etiennebbeaulac/tap
brew install git-worktrees
```

**That's it!** Commands are immediately available. ‚ú®

**First Run:**
On your first use, git-worktrees will ask you to choose your default editor (VS Code, Cursor, IntelliJ IDEA, etc.). This one-time setup takes 5 seconds and you're good to go!

```bash
wt --help  # Try it now!
```

**Updating:**
```bash
brew upgrade git-worktrees
```

### Via Install Script

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EtienneBBeaulac/git-worktrees/main/install.sh | bash
```

Then restart your shell or run: `source ~/.zshrc`

For local/offline testing, you can override downloads with a local repo path:

```bash
REPO_RAW="file://$PWD" bash install.sh
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Interactive hub - the main way to use git-worktrees
wt                       # Fuzzy-find worktrees, switch, create, manage

# Or use direct commands when you know what you want
wt new feature-branch    # Create your first worktree
wt open feature-branch   # Open specific worktree
wt remove                # Remove a worktree safely
wt list                  # List all worktrees with status

# Shorthand versions (same thing, less typing)
wtnew feature-branch     # Same as: wt new feature-branch
wtopen feature-branch    # Same as: wt open feature-branch
```

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Interactive hub - main interface
wt                           # Fuzzy-find and switch between worktrees
wt feature-x                 # Quick open/create for specific branch

# Subcommands - when you know what you want
wt new feature-x             # Create worktree for new or existing branch
wt new feature/x -b main     # Create from 'main' branch
wt open feature/x            # Open existing worktree
wt list                      # List all worktrees with status
wt list --fzf --open         # List and open selected in your editor
wt remove                    # Interactive removal (includes "Remove all detached")
wt remove -d ../repo-feature-x --delete-branch  # Remove and delete branch
wt prune                     # Remove stale worktree references
wt config edit               # Edit configuration file
wt config set editor "Cursor"  # Change your default editor
wt config get editor         # Show current editor

# Shorthand - same commands, less typing
wtnew feature-x              # Same as: wt new feature-x
wtrm                         # Same as: wt remove
wtrm --rm-detached --yes     # Bulk remove all detached worktrees
```
