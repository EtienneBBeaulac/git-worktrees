# Release Automation

You have two options for automating releases:

## Option 1: GitHub Actions (Fully Automated) ‚ú®

The GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) automatically:
- Updates the Formula in the main repo
- Creates a GitHub release with notes
- Updates the Formula in your Homebrew tap

### Setup:

1. **Create a Personal Access Token (PAT):**
   - Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens/new
   - Name: `TAP_UPDATE_TOKEN`
   - Select scopes:
     - ‚úÖ `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
     - ‚úÖ `workflow` (Update GitHub Action workflows)
   - Click "Generate token" and **copy it**

2. **Add the token to repository secrets:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/EtienneBBeaulac/git-worktrees/settings/secrets/actions
   - Click "New repository secret"
   - Name: `TAP_UPDATE_TOKEN`
   - Value: Paste the token you copied
   - Click "Add secret"

3. **That's it!** Now whenever you push a tag, everything happens automatically.

### Usage:

```bash
# Just push a tag, and GitHub Actions does the rest!
git tag -a v1.0.2 -m "Release v1.0.2"
git push origin v1.0.2

# Watch the workflow run at:
# https://github.com/EtienneBBeaulac/git-worktrees/actions
```

The workflow will:
1. Update Formula in main repo
2. Create GitHub release
3. Update Formula in homebrew-tap
4. Push changes to both repos

---

## Option 2: Local Script (Semi-Automated) üõ†Ô∏è

If you prefer to run releases locally, use the `release.sh` script:

### Usage:

```bash
# From the git-worktrees directory:
./scripts/release.sh 1.0.2

# The script will:
# 1. Create and push the tag
# 2. Calculate SHA256
# 3. Update Formula in main repo
# 4. Update Formula in homebrew-tap (if found locally)
# 5. Commit and push everything
```

### What it does:

- ‚úÖ Creates and pushes version tag
- ‚úÖ Calculates SHA256 checksum
- ‚úÖ Updates Formula in main repo
- ‚úÖ Updates Formula in tap (if `~/git/personal/homebrew-tap` exists)
- ‚úÖ Commits and pushes changes
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  You still need to manually create the GitHub release

## Comparison

| Feature | GitHub Actions | Local Script |
|---------|----------------|--------------|
| Fully automated | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ö†Ô∏è Semi (need to create GH release) |
| Requires setup | Yes (PAT token) | No |
| Creates GitHub release | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No (manual) |
| Updates main repo | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Updates tap | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes (if local) |
| Works from anywhere | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå Needs local tap clone |
| Run from CI/CD | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No |

## Recommendation

**Use GitHub Actions** if:
- ‚úÖ You want fully automated releases
- ‚úÖ You want GitHub releases created automatically
- ‚úÖ You release from different machines
- ‚úÖ You're comfortable setting up the PAT token (one-time, 5 minutes)

**Use Local Script** if:
- ‚úÖ You prefer manual control
- ‚úÖ You don't want to set up tokens
- ‚úÖ You always release from the same machine
- ‚úÖ You're okay with manually creating GitHub releases

---

## Testing

Test the workflow without creating a real release:

```bash
# Create a test tag
git tag v0.0.0-test
git push origin v0.0.0-test

# Check the workflow runs successfully
# Then delete the test tag:
git tag -d v0.0.0-test
git push origin :refs/tags/v0.0.0-test
```
