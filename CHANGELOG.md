## [1.1.0] - 2025-01-XX

### Added

#### UX: Selection Visibility
- FZF selections now echo to terminal after selection for complete workflow visibility
- Branch selection shows: "âœ“ Selected: branch-name" or "âœ“ Creating new branch: name"
- Base ref selection shows: "âœ“ Base: origin/main"
- Worktree selection in hub shows: "âœ“ Selected: branch-name"
- All selections maintain terminal history for debugging and understanding

#### UX: Editor Confirmation
- Interactive editor confirmation prompt before opening: `ðŸ“‚ Open in [editor]? [Y/n/other/save]:`
- Options to choose different editor from menu (9 popular editors)
- Option to save preference as default
- Skip prompt with `WTNEW_SKIP_EDITOR_CONFIRM=1` environment variable

#### Git-Style Subcommands
- **New subcommand interface**: `wt new`, `wt remove`, `wt open`, `wt list`, `wt prune`
- Short aliases for subcommands: `wt n`, `wt rm`, `wt o`, `wt ls`
- `wt config` subcommand for configuration management:
  - `wt config edit` - Open config in editor
  - `wt config show` - Display current configuration
  - `wt config init` - Initialize config with defaults
- `wt help` subcommand for comprehensive documentation
- Enhanced `wt --help` with subcommand overview

#### First-Run Experience
- Welcome message when no worktrees exist, explaining what worktrees are
- Clear guidance on getting started with examples
- Pointer to interactive tutorial

#### Interactive Tutorial
- `wt --tutorial` flag for step-by-step introduction
- 4-part walkthrough covering:
  1. What are worktrees and why use them
  2. How to create worktrees
  3. Managing worktrees (commands and keyboard shortcuts)
  4. Quick start workflow and tips
- Skippable at any point for experienced users

#### Better Error Messages
- Actionable error messages with helpful suggestions
- `wt_error_not_git_repo()` - Explains git repositories with examples
- `wt_error_fzf_missing()` - Installation instructions for fzf
- `wt_error_branch_exists()` - Suggests alternatives when branch exists
- All errors include "Try:" sections with concrete next steps

#### Configuration Management
- Extended config file support at `~/.config/git-worktrees/config`
- Auto-creation with smart defaults on first run
- Configuration options for:
  - Editor/IDE selection
  - Auto-open behavior
  - Auto-push for new branches
  - Worktree reuse preferences
  - UI settings (FZF height, shortcuts visibility)
- Priority system: command flags > env vars > config file
- `wt_load_full_config()` function to load all settings
- `wt_init_config()` for guided setup

#### Tests
- Comprehensive Phase 2 test coverage:
  - `test_phase2_subcommands.zsh` - Subcommand dispatch and aliases
  - `test_phase2_error_messages.zsh` - Error helper functions
  - `test_phase2_config.zsh` - Config management
  - `test_phase2_backward_compat.zsh` - Backward compatibility
- 25 new automated tests ensuring feature stability

### Changed

#### Documentation
- README restructured with clearer hierarchy:
  1. Interactive hub (primary feature)
  2. Subcommands (recommended interface)
  3. Quick access shortcuts (convenience)
- Commands section emphasizes hub-first workflow
- Quick Start updated to showcase both hub and subcommands
- Usage examples modernized with subcommand style
- Homebrew installation moved to top (recommended method)
- Removed unnecessary shell restart note for Homebrew users

#### User Experience
- All commands use consistent error messaging
- Help text updated across all commands to mention subcommands
- Version flag (`--version`) standardized across all commands
- Configuration documentation integrated into README

### Maintained

#### Backward Compatibility
- All original commands still work: `wtnew`, `wtrm`, `wtopen`, `wtls`
- No breaking changes to existing workflows
- Original command-line flags preserved
- Standalone commands positioned as "quick access" shortcuts
- Full compatibility with v1.0.x usage patterns

### Fixed
- **Critical:** Editor opening logic now respects detected/chosen editor
  - Fixed `wt_open_in_android_studio()` to only use `studio` command for Android Studio
  - Fixed fallback logic in `wtnew`, `wtopen` to respect app choice
  - Prevents wrong application from opening (e.g., Android Studio opening when Cursor selected)
- Improved editor detection with smart fallbacks
- Better handling of missing FZF with clear user guidance
- More consistent error handling across all commands
- Missing editor in `wtls --open` now shows helpful message instead of failing silently
